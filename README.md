# CODE QUIZ

This is a simple app that has a small list of questions to quiz you on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

To start, just click Start Quiz and the questions will be presented along with a timer. Answer all of the questions and then you can save your score with your name.  If you would like, you can clear the scores or start the quiz again.

Your score is calculated by answering the questions correctly and how much time is left when the quiz is finished.

Your scores are saved in Local Storage so they may be cleared out by your browser occasionally.
